As of June, 2023 the **Monolog components to enable New Relic Logs** project is archived and available for cloning only. We encourage you to experiment with it in your fork however please keep in mind that there is neither a maintainer team nor support. 

To [all contributors](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-monolog-logenricher-php/graphs/contributors), we thank you!  Without your contribution, this project would not be what it is today.
